# 🌾 F.A.R.M  
**Future of Agriculture with Revolutionary Model**  

Empowering farmers with AI-driven insights for sustainable and efficient farming. F.A.R.M leverages advanced technologies like **LLMs**, **Deep Learning**, and **Machine Learning** to revolutionize agriculture, offering features like crop disease detection, irrigation advice, multilingual interaction, and more.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🌐 **Multilingual Chatbot**:  
  Farmers can communicate via **voice** or **text** in multiple languages.

- 🧑‍🌾 **Smart Query Analysis**:  
  Queries are processed by **LLMs**, which delegate tasks to specialized agents.

- 📷 **Crop Disease Detection**:  
  Upload images for disease analysis using a **Deep Learning model**.

- 🌦️ **Irrigation Advice**:  
  Location-based weather analysis and **rain prediction** models help decide if irrigation is needed.

- 📊 **Market Insights**:  
  Get real-time crop price updates and market trends.

- 🐛 **Pest Control Guidance**:  
  Receive suggestions for pest control measures tailored to crop and region.
